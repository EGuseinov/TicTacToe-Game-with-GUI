<p align="center">This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python's Tkinter library. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) where two players can play against each other. It keeps track of the players' turns, checks for winning conditions, and displays the game result. Additionally, it includes a timer to show the duration of the game.</p>
